## GeoLocation with AngularJS 


### App Specifics

The App uses the Angular __geolocation__ module created by [Arun Israel](https://github.com/arunisrael/angularjs-geolocation). His module is a wrapper around __window.navigator.geolocation__ which is the HTML5 Location Service.
The module makes use of the [Angular $q Promise Library](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q).



### Running the App

- clone the repository
- bower install
- select _index.html_

### NOTE

Chrome does not allow the HTML5 location service to be run on locahost. 
You can use another browser like _Firefox_ that supports the HTML5 Location service or if you have Python installed you can: 
- open the command terminal and go to the directory where the program resides
- run a simple webserver by entering __python -m SimpleHTTPServer__.
